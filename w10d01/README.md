# W10D01 - Rails Review

### To Do
- [x] "Rails Week" Conversation
- [x] MVC Review
- [x] Quickly build simple Rails app
- [x] Nested Resources

### Rails Week Convo
* lots of things happening behind the scenes (magic)
* makes too many things implicit
* mvc is nice
* easy to generate routes
* ActiveRecord - not having to write sql
* project setup

### MVC
* Model - represents the data, query the database
* View - represents the webpage to be generated, view helpers (form_for, link_to)
* Controller - the brains of the operation
